A place to collect proposals for the developing Hyperfy DAO.

**Prop #0001** | 
**A Beginning For The Hyperfy DAO** |
Wed April 23, 2025

**Abstract**

Over the past three months Hyperfy V2 has developed at a rapid pace. Currently on v0.11.0 at the time of this writing, 568 commits have been pushed to the [main branch](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy).The .hyp file format was created and experimental apps have been built encompassing physics, user interfaces, inventory systems, weapons, player animations, and crypto integrations. New features continue to be added to the application interface everyday and while this progress has been overwhelmingly positive, the gaps between what different user groups require is growing along with the need for documentation and working groups to support them. As the first DAO proposal, this document aims to begin the discussion with the Hyperfy organization and the community on how to best structure the Hyperfy DAO to support the growth of the Hyperfy platform. This document does not aim to create an binding decisions directly, but to present actionable steps forward that can be taken to create the Hyperfy DAO.

**Background**

So far development has been handled in an adhoc manner mainly driven by the project creator [Ash Connell](https://x.com/AshConnell). There has been no official development schedule or roadmap and community members have contributed to the codebase and app ecosystem in ways that have come about organically as being a part of an early stage community project. This has mostly worked so far and there have been a lot of positives to listening and adapting development to what community members want, but it also has revealed some questions about the project as the scope continues to grow.

**--1--**

**(a)** What role does the community really play in the development of the project? 

**(b)** Being an open source project, what is the Hyperfy Organization(Founder Team) and its relationship to a community organization like the DAO? 

---

Currently the codebase is controlled by the Hyperfy Organization, while community members can fork and pull request changes back to the core codebase, the right to deploy to this official repo is controlled by the organization. The organization is supported currently through a 15% Founders $HYPER token allocation vesting over 3 years and by Raydium Liquidity Pool fees. However it is relevant to note, fees are currently not supporting the entire organization but only the primary team founder.

These funding mechanisms are important because they affect the relationship between the Hyperfy Organization and any future DAO or community organization. Before any community org can be formed, the Hyperfy Organization needs to decide what other funding mechanisms they would like to reserve for funding the core Hyperfy Organization and which to reserve for the community or DAO. The disbursment of these funds should also take into account the relevant income and non-income bearing services being supported either by the organization or DAO.  Examples of these income bearing services include: 

- fees from an official marketplace for hyp apps
- income from an official hosting platform for hyperfy worlds
- fees / iap style purchases attached to an official identity layer for hyperfy players
- licensing fees for large commercial studios or projects which meet a revenue threshold

Additionally there are some project components which need support, but will likely not generate direct income:

- an official documentation website
- an official landing page 
- project management duties related to the project roadmap
- management of community calls or marketing events
- project management duties related to the DAO or community orgs

To support the project longterm funding is a core topic which needs to be discussed prior to establishing working groups and any DAO structure for both the benefit of the organization and the community. Clear guidelines should be established as not to make the DAO funding a faucet for funding community pet projects, but reserved for those which make impactful platform improvements.

**(a)** Further the above questions, what is the plan for the Hyperfy Organization and supporting the open source codebase long term? 

**(b)** Seeing as there has been no official roadmap, is the goal for the Hyperfy Organization to grow into a larger team? Is the goal to cease to exist once the platform has grown to a stable state? 

---

The Hyperfy Organization at this point has essentially acted as an individual contributor to the open source project. There seems to be a lot of confusion in the community on what the longterm goal is and how it will compare to other similar engines or platforms such as Roblox, Minecraft, Godot, Unity, Unreal, etc. Creatively the message seems clear, that it will likely support a hybrid of use cases and end users, but how do we plan to do that when the scope grows bigger than what one person can handle?

**(a)** How do we want to operate a community organization like the DAO, who makes decisions?

**(b)** How do we fund this?

A lot of community members along with the team share the sentiment of learning from the failures of past DAO projects they have been a part of. Due to this many feel the ability and power of voting should be heavily limited in favor of decisions being made by a centralized designated party. The goal of the DAO is NOT to frivolously spend money like other projects have on experiences or marketing grifts, but to support projects and services which make valuable contributions to the platform ecosystem. 

At the same time, all of this is admin work that is not very exciting and takes time away from core development if it is a responsibility of the Hyperfy Organization. Due to this a role or team needs to be created whether within the Hyperfy Organization or DAO to act as the DAO admin. Cost should be considered heavily here against the time needed complete said role when establishing the DAO admin or DAO admin team as not to make this an unnecessary cost expenditure. 

**Actionable Goals**

Based on the above questions the following goals are actionable steps we can take to establish the Hyperfy DAO:

1. Establish a legal entity for the DAO which is able to receive income, pay bounties, and handle any tax implications. Determine the best region for this and the associated costs.

2. Establish an admin structure for the DAO to determine who's responsibility it is (DAO Admin) to handle standard admin duties such as: financial reporting, legal fillings, bounty distribution, and other regularly occurring admin tasks.

3. Establish a criteria for making decisions like adding or removing the DAO admin or other team roles which may become needed overtime.

4. Establish a process for the community or organization to suggest bounties and for the DAO or organization to assign bounties to community members. This process should include a clear outline of project objectives, deliverables, and cost.

5. Establish a project roadmap that includes the workings of the organization and DAO supported projects.

6. Establish what sources of revenue the DAO will have vs the organization. Will the DAO or the organization support the following services: a official marketplace for hyp apps, a official hosting platform for hyperfy worlds, a official identity layer for hyperfy players, a official documentation website, a official landing page.

7. Provide a more formal platform for discussing and creating actionable work that progresses the Hyperfy platform.
