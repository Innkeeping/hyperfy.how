**Token Allocation**


**DAO:** 30%

Currently held in a multisign wallet pending creation of DAO.

**World Holders:** 30%

World Holders were airdropped 151,000 $HYPER per Hyperfy V1 land NFT they held at the time of a snapshot in November 2024.

**Ai16z Partners:** 5%

Some Ai16z community members were eligable to claim up to 5% of the token supply due to a partner promotion.

*As of of Wednesday April 23, 2025 **10.6469%** (106,469,960) is left unclaimed of both world holders and below Ai16z partner allocation. This is no longer claimable and effectively burned, aside from wallets which completed airdrop verification, but havent claimed their stake from the smart contract.*

**Raydium Liquidity Pool:** 20%

To create the raydium liquidity pool 200m $HYPER was allocated.

**Founders:** 15%
