### Site Repo

[Repo is Here](https://github.com/Innkeeping/Hyperfy.how)

<Aside>
You can click 'Edit Page' on the bottom of any page to go directly to it in .

You can edit directly in your Github in browser if you want, without needing to clone the repo locally.  Fork the repo, make edits, make a PR to main repo.

That sound complicated?  Hop in [Discord](https://discord.gg/SzPjsvk5).  Go the #docs channel, make a suggestion and will add it.

</Aside>

Hyperfy.how is a living community resource for [Hyperfy v2.](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy)

It will continue to evolve as Hyperfy v2 progresses. (with your help! ðŸš€)

Easily add resources in markdown to the appropriate .md or .mdx file.  If needed, create a new file.  (be sure to start with frontmatter format of all others)

Sidebar and page link will autogenerate on 'resources' section based on the frontmatter title of the file in the 'resources' folder.

'resources' sidebar will be in order based on the .md/.mdx file name.

On 'guides' and up to 'welcome' section, you will need to add to astro.config.mjs. Order is based on astro.config.mjs.  Easiest is to copy from above and edit. You can have nested sidebars.
